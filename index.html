  </div>
  <div class="content inactive">
    <p class="transition visible">The DC business license you need really depends on your businesses activities. Retail and office type businesses usually just need a General Business License. The general business license classification is a catchall. It applies to businesses that have a tax identification number, but perform a business activity that does not require a special endorsement. </p>

  <div class="content inactive">
    <p class="transition visible">Some types of DC business licenses, including the DC General Business License, can be applied for on the DCRA Business Licensing website.</p><p>
If you need a special license endorsement, you will probably need to file the paper form. You can download the DC Basic Business License Application (BBL-EZ) on the DCRA Business License Division website (see link below). The DC business license application is in your online account when you sign up for DC registered agent service. It is prepopulated with our registered agent information! </p>

    <p class="transition visible">If you have a business premise located in DC and it doesn’t already have a certificate of occupancy, you will need to get one. If you live in DC and work from home, you will need a Home Occupation Permit. You can download the application on the DCRA website, but you have to submit it to the DCRA in person. They will take about 30 days to process the application.</p>
    <p>You don’t have to attach the actual certificate to your BBL-EZ application. Just write the Certificate of Occupancy number and issue date on the application.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="content inactive">
    <p class="transition visible">DC businesses have to renew the DC business license every two years. Your renewal fee is the same as the license fee, so if you have a general license, it will cost $200 every other year. The DCRA Business License Division will send you a renewal notice and invoice. Just follow the instructions on the DC business license renewal notice.</p>
    
    <p>A lot of DC businesses can renew their licenses online now. If your renewal invoice has a six-digit PIN number, you can use that to renew your business license on the DCRA website.</p>
